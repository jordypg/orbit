		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project initialization into discrete setup steps: package.json creation with dependencies, TypeScript configuration, folder structure creation, Prisma initialization, and build scripts setup. Each subtask should be independently verifiable.",
			"reasoning": "Standard project setup with well-established tooling. Multiple moving parts but each component is straightforward. Complexity comes from coordinating multiple tools (TypeScript, Prisma, Commander.js) and ensuring proper configuration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PostgreSQL Schema and Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide schema implementation into: Prisma schema definition with models and relationships, database connection setup with pooling, index creation and optimization, and CRUD helper functions with transaction support. Focus on data modeling best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving database design, indexing strategy, and ORM configuration. Requires careful consideration of data relationships, query performance, and transaction handling. Prisma adds type safety but requires understanding of its abstractions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create Pipeline Definition API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into API design components: TypeScript interface definitions for StepContext and PipelineDefinition, definePipeline() function implementation, step() wrapper function with type safety, and pipeline registry singleton with validation logic.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring solid TypeScript knowledge and API design. Need to create flexible abstractions while maintaining type safety. Registry pattern adds some complexity but is well-established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Pipeline Executor",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into execution components: PipelineExecutor class structure, sequential step execution logic, database state persistence with transactions, StepContext creation and passing, and error handling with status transitions. Ensure proper lifecycle management.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to state management, error handling, and database transactions. Core orchestration logic requires careful handling of async operations, context passing, and ensuring data consistency during execution."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Basic CLI Interface",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide CLI development into: Commander.js setup and command structure, pipeline discovery and loading mechanism, console logging with colors and progress indicators, and executable configuration with environment variable handling.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward CLI implementation using established patterns. Commander.js is well-documented, and the requirements are clear. Main complexity is in pipeline discovery and integration with the executor."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Add Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure retry implementation into: exponential backoff calculation algorithm, retry loop integration in step execution, database schema updates for retry tracking, and retry orchestration with polling mechanism. Include comprehensive failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity involving timing algorithms, async scheduling, and database state management. Exponential backoff is algorithmic, but integrating it with existing execution flow and ensuring proper state persistence adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Resume Logic for Interrupted Runs",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break resume functionality into: interrupted run detection logic, step completion state analysis, StepContext reconstruction from database, execution resumption from checkpoint, and run recovery orchestration. Handle edge cases thoroughly.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring deep understanding of execution state, context reconstruction, and edge case handling. Must handle various interruption scenarios and ensure data consistency when resuming partially completed pipelines."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Setup tRPC API with Next.js Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize tRPC setup into: Next.js 14 application initialization with App Router, tRPC server configuration and context setup, router creation for pipelines/runs/steps, client-side tRPC integration, and full-stack TypeScript type safety configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity combining multiple modern technologies. tRPC setup requires understanding of both server and client configuration, type inference, and integration with Next.js App Router. Well-documented but has multiple integration points."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build Web Dashboard UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure UI development into: shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS setup, dashboard layout and grid implementation, pipeline card components with status indicators, and responsive design with interactive elements. Focus on user experience.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity UI development with modern component libraries. Shadcn/ui provides good abstractions, but requires understanding of React patterns, responsive design, and state management for real-time updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Run Detail Page with Step Timeline",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide detail page into: dynamic routing setup for nested pages, timeline component with step visualization, error handling and display components, retry functionality with optimistic updates, and advanced UI features like JSON viewers and copy buttons.",
			"reasoning": "Higher UI complexity involving dynamic routing, complex data visualization, and interactive features. Timeline component requires careful state management, and retry functionality needs coordination between UI and API with proper error handling."
